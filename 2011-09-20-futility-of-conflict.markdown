Just a few days after Google+ was launched DeWitt Clinton <a href="https://plus.google.com/117377434815709898403/posts/UKx7b5GZw6P">posted</a> the image above and asked his audience to discuss.

I liked the most the comment by <a href="https://plus.google.com/103737858994276150670/posts">Aryeh Primus</a>:

> Clearly a statement about the futility of conflict -- for as the second iceberg is forced under the first and will perish due to the greater thermal conduction of water vs air giving the righthand iceberg a longer life, both are doomed to melt in the long run. Or, to the optimist, just a brilliant photo.

DeWitt, probably, wanted to hint to many more features to come to Google+. At that time the service was flooded with clever animated GIF images making fun of Facebook and how much Goolge+ is better. Aryeh's comment gives an interesting perspective of the "conflict" between two Internet giants and other conflicts in general.
