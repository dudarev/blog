It is not always easy to get media content from third world countries. 
Thanks to [Virtual Private Network][] (VPN) you may access external services via intermediate networks located in developed world,
and use services like Spotify, Rdio, and others that block users from outside of the US and Europe.

This is rather easy to set up  VPN on Amazon EC2 instance. 
I keep description of the process to do it in [my wiki][]. But this process needs to be done just once.
After that one can [create EBS AMI of that running instance][].
It takes less than 3 minutes to launch one in the future.
