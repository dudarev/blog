It is not always easy to get media content from third world countries. 
Thanks to services like <a href="http://www.supervpn.net/">SuperVPN</a> you may access external services via intermediate networks located in developed world 
and use services like Spotify, Rdio, and others that block users from outside of the US and Europe.

This is rather easy to set up <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network">Virtual Private Network</a> (VPN) on Amazon EC2 instance. 
The whole process is described in the relevant section of <a href="http://dudarev.com/wiki/Amazon-web-services.html">my wiki</a>.
You may save an image of the virtual machine and use it later when needed. It just takes some time.

SuperVPN offers a <a href="http://www.supervpn.net/free-vpn.html">free service</a> for a blog post. So I am checking how it works and will extend this post after I'll try it.
