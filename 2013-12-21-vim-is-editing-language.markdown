> Do you want to process words or edit text?

I am using vim for more than 12 years, most of the time as my primary editor for text and code.

## Power of Context

We are constantly switching contexts. In our lives we play different roles: children, parents, employees, employers etc. In each role we adjust our behaviour to suit it more. During a day we may shift from one role to another.

A context related lifehack that I found recently: In a given time, I typically participate in several projects. Last year, I found out that it was very effective to create different accounts in my computer OS for such different contexts. It did make the process more efficient.

One of the most important concepts for beginners starting to use vim is that working with it we also are switching contexts. 

When we just open it we are in moving context that allows us to move around efficiently.

Going into editing mode.
